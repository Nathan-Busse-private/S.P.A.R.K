Old overall weight:
-------------------

Total weight 886 grams excluding top plate and psu and battery holder.
Total weight of servos = 660 grams
886 + 660 = 1546 grams
Weight of electronics with Arduino = 32.6 grams
Weight of electronics with Raspberry Pi 4B = 53.6 grams
Current weeith of robot with Arduino = 1578.6 grams = 1.5786 = 1.58 kilograms
Current weight of robot with Raspberry Pi 4B = 1599.6 grams = 1.5996 = 1.60 kilograms

IMPORTANT:
---------

I made a calculation error for the overall robot weight: 
See journal for more info.

Did some modifications to the following parts to correlate with the correct calculations:

Old part weights:

Femur = 197 grans
Tibia = 105 grams
Paw   = 117 grams
Total = 419 grams

New part weights:

Femur = 67  grams
Tibia = 66  grams
Paw   = 16  grams
Total = 149 grams

# Correcting the old weight to match the new part's overall weight.

Old weight (Arduino) 	     = 1578.6 grams
Old weight (Raspberry Pi 4B) = 1599.6 grams
Total old parts weight	     = 419.00 grams

# Removing old part values from overall weight (Arduino):

Overall weight(Arduino) - Total

1578.6 - 419 = 1159.6 grams

Total without Old parts = 1159.6

Adding New part values to Total without Old parts(Arduino):

Total without Old parts + 149

1159.6 + 149 = 1308.6 grams

New Overall weight in grams with Arduino = 1308.6 grams

					 = 1.31 kilograms


# Removing old part values from overall weight (Raspberry Pi 4B):

Overall weight(Arduino) - Total

1599.6 - 419 = 1180.6 grams

Total without Old parts = 1180.6

Adding New part values to Total without Old parts(Raspberry Pi 4B):

Total without Old parts + 149

1180.6 + 149 = 1329.6 grams

New Overall weight in grams with Raspberry Pi 4B = 1329.6 grams

					         = 1.33 kilograms

# New overall weight:
---------------------

Arduino         = 1.31 Kg

Raspberry Pi 4B = 1.33 Kg
